# VXML Final Report Templates

This repository contains templates for the [PIMS
VXML](https://vxml.pims.math.ca) final reports and posters.

## Posters
Poster templates can be found in the [poster sub-directory](./poster). There are
two $\LaTeX$ based templates for generating generic academic posters. Each
template includes a rendered PDF sample showing the typical output.  The poster
templates are provided for _convenience only_, you are free to use your
favourite tools to produce something similar to the PDF samples.

## Final Reports
Final report templates can be found in the [final-report sub-directory](./final-report)
sub-directory. There are two sample documents/templates. One is a $\LaTeX$
document and the other is a Markdown document. You are free to use either to
produce your report. The markdown document actually contains two templates, one
of which uses [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to produce a nice rendered output.
The `pandoc` version template will be used to produce the final PDF version of
your report, but you do not need to use pandoc while writing and submitting your
report, plain markdown is fine.

There are further details on the templates in each of the sub-directories.
