# VXML Poster Templaets

There are two templates for academic posters available in this sub-directory.
Both templates use the `beamer` document class. You are not required to use
either $\LaTeX$ or either of these templates, they are simply provided for
convenience. The poster should be submitted as a PDF document, but you may use
any tools you like to produce it. If you would like to use $\LaTeX$ there is a
[poster gallery](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/poster) of available
templates on [overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com).

## Poster 1

[poster-1](./poster-1) is based on [this
template](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/decaf-poster/ryfhdpmwcnpd). It can
be compiled with the ordinary `pdflatex` command. 

## Poster 2
[poster-2](./poster-2) is based on [this
template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/unofficial-poster-template-for-uchicago-computer-science/kbbmbdxwbypb)
and requires a Lua based $\LaTeX$ installation. It can be compiled with the
`xelatex` command.
